# UniBotJS
New discord bot based on Javascript and node.js for "La Sapienza Computer Science" server.

This bot can be easily adapted to other university servers.

When first starting the server, make sure you have created a config.json file in the root directory of the bot with the following structure:
```
{
  "token": "your_token_here",
  "adminChannel": "your_admin_channel_id_here",
  "newsChannel": "your_news_channel_id_here",
  "newsInoltrerChannel": "your_news_inoltrer_channel_id_here",
}
```
